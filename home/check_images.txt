Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer:  The VGG aned ResNet architechtures, same classify the breed of dog in french_bulldog_01.jpg while the AlexNet differently classify the breed. Although all the three model doesn't classify correctly.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: All of the model classify the wolf_01.jpg and bucket.jpg to not be dog.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The AlexNet and ResNet have same results, the variations in the results is due to the fact that I have chosen wolf as Not-dog to check the performance. The "Wolf" has most similar structure like dog, that's why these architecture perform not well on the four uploaded images. However the overall result of Alexnet and ResNet are better.
